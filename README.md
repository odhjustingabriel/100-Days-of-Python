# 🛡️ 100 Days of Python - Cybersecurity Focus  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** challenge! Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding daily to master Python with a focus on **cybersecurity**.  

## 🎯 Goals  
✅ Strengthen my Python programming skills.  
✅ Explore cybersecurity concepts like automation, cryptography, and ethical hacking.  
✅ Build real-world security scripts and tools.  
✅ Document my learning journey and share insights.  

## 🔥 Why Python for Cybersecurity?  
Python is a go-to language for cybersecurity due to its:  
🔹 **Ease of Use** –   
🔹 **Powerful Libraries** – Supports cryptography, networking, and automation.  
🔹 **Penetration Testing** – Used in tools like Nmap, Scapy, and Metasploit.  
🔹 **Security Automation** – Speeds up vulnerability scanning and malware analysis.
